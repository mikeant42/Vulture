Idea for a game.

You open the game and come to a gui

        Username : ______
        Password : ______
        Join/Create World : ______
        Difficulty : __

The game will generate a world based on those parameters. Each world is unique. If you join a world already created,
it will put you into that world with the other players, where they will see you, and vice versa. As the difficulty goes
up, PVP may be possible.

Each world will individually create unique quests, creatures, locations, races, etc. Completing quests of varying
difficulty allows one to level up.

This combo allows for an infinite of possibilities. For example, a "popular" world with a high difficulty might be one
that all of the high-level players go to in order to fight each other.
